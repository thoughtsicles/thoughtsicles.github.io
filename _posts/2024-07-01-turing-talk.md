I am in Vancouver with Sabee, whose work was accepted in STOC, a top-tier conference for theoretical computer science. Avi Widgerson, who just won the Turing Award, gave his award talk at the conference on the subject of Alan Turing. He covered a few papers from each academic period of Alan's career. We learned that Alan Turing was not afraid to formulate or attack fundamental questions in any field, regardless of his level of expertise. He wrote a paper in the field of biology which has over 20k citations, in which he puts forth a mathematical model of how asymmetrical structures in plants and animals can arise from an initially symmetrical and homogenous cell. Some structures he was able to derive mathematically; others by simulation (this was towards the end of his career, by which point he was able to reserve computer access Thursday and Sunday nights!).
